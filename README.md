# Data Analytics portfolio

- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I am a quantitative researcher transitioned from academia to industry with 6+ years of experience in delivering insights from quantitative and qualitative analyses.
I am proficient in R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau; and skilled in reporting results and insights in written reports and presentations.

- ðŸ’¼ My most recent position as a UX research assistant with Meta allowed me to practice these skills in business use cases. I have demonstrated the ability to analyze complex datasets, build dashboards and present valuable insights. 

- ðŸ“Š In this portfolio, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my programming and data analytics skills. I have mainly used SQL and R for data cleaning, merging, analysis, and visualization. I have also used Tableau for reporting insights. 

- âœ… I believe that my research experience, analytical mindset, and communication skills will make me a great candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find this portfolio informative, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my experience with you further. 

- ðŸ“§ Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.
