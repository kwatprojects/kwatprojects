## Data Analytics with R </font>

### 👩‍💻 My data analytics journey started with R!   

🌱 I first learned R for ecological studies, where we statistically determined animal habitat and resource selection. 
As a quantative ecologist, I taught myself doing spatial and movement modeling with animal GPS data in R. 

💡 In this process, I also learned skills and techniques that are transferable to any analyst/ research role!

### 🔥 R is a powerful tool for:  
- Data cleaning
- Data merging
- Data analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Spatial analysis
- Data visualization

📊 and Data visualization with ggplot2 is my favorite things to do in R!  I really like that it is highly customizable and reproducible!

I will be uploading more projects with R, so stay tune!
