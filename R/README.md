## Data Analytics with R </font>

👩‍💻 R is where my data analytics journey started! I have used R for 
- Data cleaning
- Data merging
- Data analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization

📊 Data visualization with ggplot2 is one of my favorite things to do in R! 

I will be uploading more projects with R, so stay tune!
